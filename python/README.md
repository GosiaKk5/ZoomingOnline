# Python Backend for ZoomingOnline

This directory contains all the Python-related code for the ZoomingOnline project. It serves as the backend, providing data processing, conversion utilities, and a local server for testing.

## Key Components

### 1. `src`
The `src` directory contains the core Python source code, including:
- **Data Converters**: Scripts to convert data from HDF5 to Zarr format (`convert_hdf5_to_zarr.py`).
- **Data Generation**: Utilities to generate realistic test data (`generate_data.py`).
- **S3 Importer**: A tool for importing data to an S3-compatible object store (`data_to_s3_importer.py`).
- **CORS Server**: A simple HTTP server with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) enabled, used to serve Zarr data to the frontend during local development (`cors_server.py`).

### 2. `tests`
This directory contains all the Python tests for the project, written using the `pytest` framework. These tests ensure the correctness of the data converters, generators, and other utilities.

### 3. `examples`
Contains example scripts and configurations, such as a sample Slurm script (`run_importer.slurm`) for running the data importer on a cluster.

### 4. `check.sh` and `fix.sh`
These are linting and formatting scripts used to maintain code quality:
- `check.sh`: Runs `ruff` and `black` to check for linting errors and formatting issues.
- `fix.sh`: Automatically fixes any issues found by the linters.

### 5. Project and Dependency Management
- `pyproject.toml`: The main configuration file for the Python project, defining dependencies, project metadata, and tool settings.
- `uv.lock`: The lock file generated by `uv`, ensuring reproducible builds by pinning the exact versions of all dependencies.
- `.python-version`: Specifies the Python version used for this project.
